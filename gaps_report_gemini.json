  "AC-2": "The control is **partially implemented** based on the provided company policy. \n\nHere's why:\n\n**Fulfilled Aspects:**\n\n* **Creation:** The policy mandates a written request and management approval for new accounts, ensuring oversight in account creation.\n* **Disabling:** The policy enforces disabling accounts upon termination and outlines a clear process for disabling inactive accounts after 45 days.\n* **Uniquely Identifiable:** The policy requires all accounts to have unique usernames. \n\n**Partially Fulfilled or Unclear Aspects:**\n\n* **Deletion:** The policy details disabling inactive accounts but doesn't explicitly mention a process for deleting those accounts.  While deletion might be implied, it's not stated outright.\n* **System Accounts:** The policy focuses heavily on employee and third-party accounts. While the \"Account Management\" section mentions system administrators managing accounts, it's not explicit about the controls around dedicated system accounts (accounts used by applications or services, not humans).  \n* **\"Use\" of System Accounts:** NIST AC-2 implies monitoring and controlling the *usage* of system accounts (e.g., logging and auditing their activities). The company policy doesn't address this aspect clearly.\n\n**To achieve full implementation, the company policy should:**\n\n1. **Specify a deletion policy:**  Define when and how inactive accounts are deleted after being disabled.\n2. **Address system accounts explicitly:** Include a section detailing the creation, management, and usage oversight for system accounts specifically.\n3. **Incorporate usage monitoring:**  Describe how the company monitors and audits the activities of system accounts to detect anomalies. \n \nBy addressing these points, the company can better align its policy with the comprehensive requirements of NIST AC-2. \n",
  "AC-2(1)": "Based on the provided company policy, the **NIST Control AC-2(1) is partially implemented**. \n\nHere's why:\n\n**Partially Implemented:**\n\n* **Manual Account Management:** The policy explicitly states that account management activities like disabling inactive accounts and reviewing accounts are done **manually**. For example: \" *If the account continues to remain inactive for 15 days, it will be manually disabled.*\" This indicates a lack of automation in managing account activities. \n* **Some Automated Processes:** While not explicitly mentioned, the policy references password expiration aligning with the company's password policy. This suggests some level of automation might be in place for password management, which falls under account activity.\n\n**Missing:**\n\n* **No Mention of Automated Tools:** The policy doesn't explicitly state the use of automated tools for managing account creation, modification, or disabling. \n* **Reliance on Manual Processes:** The policy heavily emphasizes manual processes and reviews, highlighting the absence of comprehensive automated solutions.\n\n**To fully implement NIST Control AC-2(1), the company should:**\n\n1. **Adopt Automated Tools:** Implement tools that can automatically manage account lifecycles, including creation, modification, and disabling, based on pre-defined rules and triggers.\n2. **Automate Account Review:** Replace manual monthly reviews with automated systems that flag inactive accounts and trigger disablement workflows.\n3. **Integrate with HR Systems:** Connect account management tools with HR systems to automate account creation during onboarding and disablement upon termination.\n4. **Document Automation Processes:** Update the company policy to explicitly mention the use of automation tools and outline the automated processes for account management. \n",
  "AC-2(3)": "The control is **partially implemented** according to the provided company policy. \n\nHere's why:\n\n* **Partially Implemented:** The company policy states that information system accounts are reviewed **monthly** to identify inactive accounts. If an account is inactive for **30 days**, the owners and their manager are notified, and the account is disabled after **15 more days of inactivity**. \n* **Discrepancy with NIST:** This deviates from the NIST control's recommendation of disabling accounts after a specific period of inactivity (e.g., 30 days). The company policy has a longer grace period (45 days) and includes a notification process before disabling the account.\n\n**To fully implement the NIST control**, the company should revise its policy to ensure:\n\n1. **Shorter inactivity period:**  Reduce the inactivity period from 45 days to align with a specific timeframe, ideally 30 days or less, as recommended by NIST.\n2. **Automatic disablement:**  Implement automatic disablement of accounts after the specified inactivity period without requiring manual intervention or a separate notification process.\n\nBy addressing these points, the company can strengthen its security posture and meet the requirements of the NIST control more effectively. \n",
  "AC-2(5)": "The control is **fully implemented** according to the provided company policy. \n\nHere's why:\n\n* **NIST AC-2(5)** focuses on preventing or restricting shared/group accounts.\n* **The company policy** explicitly states: **\"Shared accounts on {COMPANY-NAME} information systems are not permitted.\"** \n\nThis language demonstrates a clear and complete alignment with the NIST control's objective. The policy outright bans shared accounts, effectively preventing their use and fulfilling the control's requirement. \n",
  "AC-2(7)": "Based on the provided information, the NIST control AC-2(7) is **partially implemented** at best, but more likely **missing**. Here's why:\n\n* **Lack of Explicit Mention:** The company policy does not explicitly mention multi-factor authentication (MFA) at all. While it details account creation, management, and password policies, MFA is not addressed.\n* **Focus on Passwords:** The policy heavily emphasizes password management as a primary security measure. While strong passwords are essential, they are not a replacement for MFA, especially for privileged accounts.\n* **Privileged Account Definition:** The policy defines \"Security Administrator\" and \"System Administrator\" but doesn't explicitly categorize them as \"privileged accounts\".  It's possible these roles fall under that umbrella, but without a clear link, we can't assume MFA is enforced for them.\n\n**To claim full implementation of AC-2(7), the company policy should:**\n\n1. **Explicitly define** what constitutes a \"privileged account\" within the company's context.\n2. **Mandate MFA** for all identified privileged accounts without exception.\n3. **Specify details** about the accepted MFA methods (e.g., hardware tokens, software tokens, biometric verification). \n\n**In conclusion**, while the company policy demonstrates a focus on account management, the absence of explicit MFA requirements, especially for privileged accounts, indicates a gap in security controls compared to NIST recommendations. \n",
  "AC-5": "The provided company policy indicates **partial implementation** of NIST Control AC-5 (Separation of Duties). \n\nHere's why:\n\n**Elements of AC-5 present in the company policy:**\n\n* **Principle of Least Privilege:** The policy explicitly states, \"Information system user accounts are to be constructed so that they enforce the most restrictive set of rights/privileges or accesses required for the performance of tasks associated with an individual\u2019s account.\"  This aligns with limiting the potential damage from a compromised account, a key aspect of separation of duties.\n* **Account Management:** The policy details robust procedures for account creation, modification, disabling, and removal. Active account management is crucial for enforcing separation of duties throughout an employee's lifecycle within the company.\n\n**Elements of AC-5 missing or unclear in the company policy:**\n\n* **Explicit Separation of Duties:** While the policy mentions avoiding conflicts of interest, it lacks a clear statement prohibiting a single user from having the ability to authorize, perform, review, and audit a single transaction. This explicit separation is a cornerstone of AC-5.\n* **Specific Examples:** The policy would benefit from concrete examples of how separation of duties is implemented for critical tasks. For instance, it could state that an employee who initiates a purchase order cannot be the one to approve it. \n* **Enforcement and Auditing:** The policy mentions an \"independent audit review\" but doesn't specify the frequency or scope. Regular audits are essential to ensure the ongoing effectiveness of separation of duties controls.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe company policy demonstrates a good understanding of access control and account management principles. However, it falls short of fully implementing AC-5 by not explicitly defining and enforcing separation of duties for sensitive operations.  To achieve full compliance, the company should revise its policy to include clearer language and procedures related to preventing any single user from holding excessive privileges that could compromise security. \n",
  "AC-6": "The control is **partially implemented**. \n\nHere's why:\n\n**Evidence of Implementation:**\n\n* **\"Information system user accounts are to be constructed so that they enforce the most restrictive set of rights/privileges or accesses required for the performance of tasks associated with an individual\u2019s account.\"**  This statement directly reflects the principle of least privilege outlined in NIST AC-6.\n* **Account Management Procedures:** The policy outlines procedures for account creation, modification, disablement, and review, all of which are crucial for managing access effectively.\n* **Separation of Duties:** The policy mandates that \"accounts shall be created so that no one user can authorize, perform, review, and audit a single transaction.\" This aligns with least privilege by preventing any single user from having excessive control.\n\n**Gaps in Implementation:**\n\n* **Lack of Specificity:** While the policy mentions the principle of least privilege, it doesn't provide concrete guidance on *how* to determine the least privilege for different roles and responsibilities. \n* **No Mention of Periodic Review:** While inactive accounts are addressed, there's no mention of periodically reviewing active accounts to ensure their privileges are still appropriate (especially after job changes or role adjustments).\n* **Limited Scope:** The policy focuses heavily on account management but doesn't explicitly address other aspects of access control, such as:\n    * Network segmentation\n    * Data classification and access controls based on data sensitivity \n    * Access controls for applications and specific functionalities within applications \n\n**To fully implement NIST AC-6, the company should:**\n\n1. **Develop a Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) model:** Define specific roles within the organization and map the minimum privileges needed for each role.\n2. **Establish a process for periodic access reviews:** Regularly review user access rights (at least annually or when job roles change) to ensure they still align with the principle of least privilege.\n3. **Expand the policy scope:** Include guidance on network segmentation, data classification, and application-level access controls.\n4. **Provide practical examples:** Include scenarios and examples in the policy to illustrate how to apply least privilege in different situations.\n\nBy addressing these gaps, the company can strengthen its access control posture and move closer to full implementation of NIST AC-6. \n",
  "IA-5": "The provided company policy appears to be **partially implemented** compared to NIST Control IA-5. Here's why:\n\n**Implemented Aspects:**\n\n* **Password Expiration:** The policy explicitly states, \"All accounts must have a password expiration that complies with the {COMPANY-NAME} Password Policy.\" This suggests some form of password expiration is enforced.\n* **Account Disablement:** The policy mandates disabling accounts \"immediately upon notification of any employee\u2019s termination\" and after 15 days of inactivity. This contributes to the control's aim of limiting access. \n\n**Partially Implemented or Unclear Aspects:**\n\n* **Password Complexity:** While the policy mentions default passwords adhering to the company's password policy, it doesn't explicitly mention requirements for complexity (e.g., minimum length, character types) for regular passwords.  \n* **Password Reuse Limits:** The policy is silent on whether users are prevented from reusing their previous passwords. This is a key aspect of IA-5.\n* **History Tracking:** The policy doesn't mention anything about tracking password history to prevent immediate reuse of old passwords.\n\n**To fully implement NIST Control IA-5, the company policy should:**\n\n1. **Explicitly define password complexity requirements:** State the minimum length, required character types (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols), and forbidden character sequences.\n2. **Establish password reuse limitations:** Specify how many previous passwords users are prevented from reusing.\n3. **Incorporate password history tracking:** Document that the system logs previous passwords and prevents reuse within the defined history limit. \n\n**In conclusion, while the company policy addresses password expiration and account disablement, it lacks specific details regarding password complexity, reuse limits, and history tracking. Clarifying and incorporating these elements will bring the policy into full compliance with NIST Control IA-5.** \n",
  "IA-2": "The analysis indicates the company policy **partially implements** NIST IA-2. \n\nHere's why:\n\n**Fully Implemented Aspects:**\n\n* **Identification and Authentication Required:** The policy mandates unique usernames and passwords for all accounts, aligning with the core requirement of identification and authentication before granting access.\n* **Account Management:** The policy emphasizes robust account management practices covering creation, modification, disabling, and removal. This directly supports the \"ensure\" aspect of the NIST control by establishing mechanisms to manage access effectively.\n* **Least Privilege:** The policy enforces the principle of least privilege, requiring accounts to have the minimum necessary permissions. This limits potential damage from compromised accounts, strengthening access control.\n\n**Partially Implemented or Unclear Aspects:**\n\n* **Authentication Mechanisms:** While the policy mentions passwords, it doesn't specify other potential authentication factors (e.g., multi-factor authentication). NIST IA-2 broadly refers to \"authentication,\" implying a need to consider stronger authentication methods beyond basic passwords. \n* **Access Granting Process:** The policy focuses on account lifecycle management but lacks details on how access is granted initially. It mentions approvals for account creation but doesn't explicitly state how this translates to system or application access.  \n* **Continuous Monitoring:** The policy outlines periodic account reviews but doesn't explicitly mention continuous monitoring for unauthorized access attempts. Real-time monitoring and response are essential for a comprehensive implementation of IA-2. \n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n* **Strengthen Authentication:** Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) to enhance security beyond passwords.\n* **Define Access Granting Procedures:** Document the step-by-step process of how users are granted access after account creation, including any specific authorization checks. \n* **Implement Continuous Monitoring:** Deploy tools and processes for real-time monitoring and alerting on suspicious login attempts or unauthorized access.\n\nBy addressing these gaps, the company can transition from partial to full implementation of NIST IA-2, significantly bolstering its access control posture. \n"
